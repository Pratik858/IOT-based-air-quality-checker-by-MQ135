# IOT-based-air-quality-checker-by-MQ135

Air Pollution is increasing heavily these days due to the 
many important factors like Vehicle Emissions, Deforestation, Industrialization. Old vehicles 
could produce more smoke and hence those vehicles could be banned from using. But we 
need a proper metric that tells us whats the intensity level of air pollution, whether it is low, 
medium or high. So, we can take help of various sensors that could detect the air quality and 
from the corresponding values, we do mathematical calculations and from that results, we 
could fix the threshold value from which we can say whether the desired air quality is below 
the threshold value or not.
